# Movies-ETL

### Purpose:
Amazing Prime Video is a platform for streaming TV shows and movies on Amazing Prime, the world's largest online retailer. The Amazing Prime Video team want an algorithm to predict which low-budget movies will become popular, so they can buy the streaming rights at a bargain. To do this, Amazing Prime decided to sponsor a "hackathon" where they provide a clean set of movie data and ask participants to predict the popular pictures.  Our job is to supply that clean data.

### Overview:
1. Create an ETL pipeline from raw data to a SQL database.
2. Extract data from disparate sources using Python.
3. Clean and transform data using Pandas.
4. Use regular expressions to parse data and to transform text into numbers.
5. Load data with PostgreSQL.

## Summary
### Extract, Transform, Load (ETL)
We extracted the data from csv files, transformed that data by cleaning the individual datasets and merging them, and loaded that data into clean, concise files.
